# OutterSpace
My personal toy-engine I am using to learn about stuff. 

Currently is doing almost anything, since I am still building the basi skeleton of the rendering pipeline, also, is still full of a lot of debug/testing code, so, expect a lot of very bad code all over the place and some hacky solutions for prototyping purposes.
