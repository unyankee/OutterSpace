# OutterSpace
My personal toy-engine I am using to learn about stuff. 

Currently is doing almost nothing, since I am still building the basi skeleton of the rendering pipeline, also, is still full of a lot of debug/testing code, so, expect a lot of very bad code all over the place and some hacky solutions for prototyping purposes, and a lot of code where it is not supposed to be.



# Build
Build options will be added soon, right now the solution itslef should be here, but there is a command line for Genie and vs2019 in the build folder
