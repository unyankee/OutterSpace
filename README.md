# OutterSpace
My personal toy-engine I am using to learn about stuff. 

Currently is doing almost nothing, since I am still building the basic skeleton of the rendering pipeline, also, is still full of a lot of debug/testing code, so, expect a lot of very bad code all over the place and some hacky solutions for prototyping purposes, and a lot of code where it is not supposed to be.
Including alot of warnings, and really messy comments, I will start removing everything that is wrong and cleaning the whole project, once I can find a proper API I am happy to work with, what means, it will be constantly changing and it will not look ¨professional¨ it quite some time

In addittion to everythig already said, even the projects distribution is wrong, right now, everything ¨working¨ is in a main project that builds everything, and there are 2 other small projects with some ideas of stuff that I would like to test, but did not have much time to work on them 

# Build
Build options will be added soon, right now the solution itslef should be here, but there is a command line for Genie and vs2019 in the build folder
